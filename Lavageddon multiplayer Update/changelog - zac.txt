7/18 - 	Networking Prototype working well, construction stage working with multiple clients. laggy on non master-client server when placing blocks.
	Physics simulation working, without too much jerkyness (in most cases), Always start simulation on master client.
	
	things that need doing / notes:
		try and fix the lag when RPC master to make blocks.
		add a gun with projectiles that dmg blocks (look in PlayerMovement).
		(Roy) is working on players moving with rafts.
		need to test if players can see and update eachother smoothly.
		sometimes the rafts get weird in the simulation stage, (look into the temp placement block interfeiring?)
